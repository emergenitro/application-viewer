Hello,

Thanks for applying to start a Hack Club. As much as I enjoyed reading your application, I'm sorry to say that we are not able to move forward with your club.
We no longer accept applications from college or university students so that we can focus on our mission of bringing high school students together to make interesting things with code in high school clubs.

We’d love to answer any questions you have, just reply to this email.

Thank you for your interest!

— Jared @ Hack Club HQ
